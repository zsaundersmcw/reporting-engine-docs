# Litmos Reporting Engine 

This is intended to collect, store, and distribute information about Litmos' Reporting Engine.

## Navigating this site

The goal of this format is to make navigation as simple as feasible. The Reporting Engine is very powerful, but rather complex, so boiling it down to sections is rather difficult. 

It is recommended that you begin by navigating to where you think the information you would like is stored. The main tabs, found directly above, is going to house larger topics, and information on the particulars will be stored in subsections to the left. 

If you aren't able to find what you are looking for, feel free to use the search box at the top; that should bring you where you want to go.
